        <h1 class="rainbow-animation">Welcome</h1>
        <p>Hello, welcome to my website, here you can download my creations. <br>I don't want this website to be beatufiul, i
            just made it when i was bored, maybe i will add some style to it some day...<br><strong>Also if your browser will
                tell you that files you will download here are malicious, they are not, browsers are just noticing that you
                download files that are with .py extension or from unknown creator, you can even see the code if you are still
                not sure.</strong></p>

        <h2>statboi the Discord bot</h2>
        <p>First of all, i wanna show you my Discord bot, i am programmer of it, but i'm creating it together with my friend
            Niokki who makes avatars, and grapical concepts, our bot is on <a
                href="https://top.gg/bot/801110934571581470">top.gg</a> and at the moment it's on over 200 servers, it still
            grows up. Basically it's statistics and multi-purpose bot.</p>

        <h2>EZbot</h2>
        <p>EZbot is a Discord bot app made in Python using Discord.py, that let's you use and customize your own bot without
            coding! All you need to do is to have Python installed and host your bot! It's really simple. I'm still working on
            it, but you can download it <a href="https://github.com/statboi/EZbot">here</a></p>

        <p>I made many, many, many things, some are pubic, some are private, or for my friends. I made PyDisc, simple tool to
            calculate total, free, and used disk space, in GB and in percents. My games in Unity, that are in development, and
            only my friends got access to it at the moment. And yeah, that's basically it... Oh! And, i made Discord Rich
            Presence rickroller, you just need to run this using Python, enable presence in Discord settings, and than it will
            make presence with buttons and lyrics of <a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ">Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You
